# Building with Langchain

Come along as I hack my way through multiple use cases for Langchain and LLM tools.

## To Run notebook

Make sure have `python 3.11.1` installed

` pip3 install requirements.txt`

For now, look at `start.ipynb` to see my current progress. I will develop a more coherent structure later on.

Make sure you load your relevant API Keys. In my notebook all necessary keys are as follows: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`

To run langflow UI just type `langflow`
